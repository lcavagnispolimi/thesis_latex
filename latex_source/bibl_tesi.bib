@article{1464-4258-4-6-371,
	Abstract = {The laser diode self-mixing (or feedback) interferometric technique is reviewed as a general tool for remote sensing applications. The operating principle is outlined, and the attainable performance is compared to conventional coherent detection. Applications to metrology and to new sensing schemes are described, experimental results are reported and the overall performance of the sensors are assessed.},
